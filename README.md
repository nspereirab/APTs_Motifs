# APTs_Motifs - Motif Detection in DNA Sequences

This repository contains a Python script for motif detection in DNA sequences. It was designed to facilitate the identification of specific patterns in aptamer sequences, particularly in studies related to protein-DNA interactions.

## Description

This script allows for the search of specific motifs within DNA aptamer sequences, and it can be useful for bioinformatics analysis, experimental validation, and aptamer design studies.

## Contents

- `Figure1_MotifsCode.py`: The main script for motif detection in sequences.
- `README.md`: Explanation of the repository and usage instructions.

## Requirements

To run the script, you need to have:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Python libraries:
  - `Bio` (from the Biopython package for handling biological sequences)

You can install Biopython by running:
```bash
pip install biopython
